[Money Tree 101: How to Care for Money Trees](https://bloomscape.com/plant-care-guide/money-tree/#:~:text=Your%20Money%20Tree%20prefers%20deep,is%20never%20standing%20in%20water.)

> Your Money Tree prefers deep but infrequent watering. Water your Money Tree when the top 50%-75% of the soil is dry. Water the plant until it runs from the drainage holes and discard any excess water from the saucer. To prevent root rot, make sure your plant is never standing in water. Be sure to turn your Money Tree each time you water to allow for even growth and leaf development. Your Money Tree requires less water in the winter months when growth slows.
