# Watering

* Deep but infrequent watering
* Water heavily, then allow soil to dry to 3‚Äù depth before watering again
* Water when the top 50%-75% of the soil is dry.
* Water until it runs from the drainage holes and discard any excess water from the saucer.
* Turn each time you water to allow for even growth and leaf development.
* Requires less water in the winter months when growth slows.

# Fertilizer

* Higher nitrogen in spring, balanced in summer, higher potassium/phosphorous in fall, no fertilizer in winter
* Feed once a month in the spring and summer when it is producing new leaves
* Feed with water-soluble, well-balanced plant food at half recommended strength (e.g., 20-20-20).
* No fertilizer is necessary during the winter when plant growth naturally slows.
* Always make sure the soil is damp before applying any fertilizer.
